              with your organisations specifications, ensuring that the newly learned skills
              are directly transferable into your work place and that participants are trained
              in your unique rules, policies, systems and procedures so they can have immediate
              impact following their training.

              A better skilled and more knowledgeable workforce will increase organisational
              performance, this will be further enhanced by increased team and collaborative
              working which is developed through the shared learning experience which
              organisational based learning brings.
